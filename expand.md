Answer the following questions to the best of your abilities, please write complete answers with adequate detail. Put these in a file titled expand.md and place it in the root of your repo.

1) Why is it important to put thought into your IDs & Classes when it comes to technology intersections? (e.g. how HTML, CSS, and JS intersect)

It is important to put thought into the IDs and Classes because if it isn't given thought, it can cause complications when you need to implement it in Javascript. This can mak writing code more difficult and amplify the chance of miscommunication if working in a group.

2) What are Data attributes? Why might they be useful? How do you access them? What are the implications of using Data attributes when it comes to things like microdata?

Data attributes are ways that we can describe a specific element and attach these elements with charactaristics. You can access them by following the object with the data attribute like obj.attr. The implications of using data attributes are that you can attach them to objects and this allows you to be able to get specific data.

3) What is a DOM fragment? Why are they powerful?

A DOM fragment is a fragment that isn't apart of the main DOM. They are powerful because they allow for changes to be made which don't affect the main DOM.

4) What is the point of a “Virtual DOM”? What do you gain? What do you lose?

A "virtual DOM" is made to improve performace. You gain more flexibility with the application but at the cost of using more memory.

5) In JavaScript, usually you can reference every attribute of an element with a dot selector followed by the attribute name, except for the class attribute, which is className. Why is this so?

This is so because it could cause conflict with the keyword class in javascript.

6) What is the difference between using addEventListener() and something like onClick() ? What are the advantages / disadvantages of both?

By using onClick, it is simple and you know what it will do, but a con is that it may not be as powerful. When using EventListener, you can do more but it is longer to write and more complicated..
