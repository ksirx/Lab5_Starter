I used AI in both sections to debug and ask questions about event listeners.

## Questions for Explore Part 3

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

I wouldn't for this because unit testing may not be able to test how an application is performing on a grand scheme so it wouldn't be feasable to test if the message is properly recieved by another user.

3) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

I would because the "max message length" is something that can be tested independent of any users so this property is an edge case that would work well with unit testing.
